# Bank-Marketing-Campaign-EDA_

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on analyzing and visualizing a dataset related to customer behavior, specifically for a marketing campaign. The goal of this project is to derive insights about customer demographics, response patterns, and behavior by analyzing key features, such as age, marital status, education, and response to the campaign.

Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and creating new columns for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analysis to understand the distribution of data and identify key patterns.
Data Aggregation: Grouping and calculating mean, median, and other statistical metrics to derive insights from different customer segments.
Visualizations: Various plots such as bar charts, box plots, heatmaps, etc., to showcase relationships between different features and the target variable (response_flag).
Advanced Insights: Investigating how demographic features like age, education, marital status, and loan status influence the response to the campaign.
